Please refer to "Nucleosome positions establish an extended mutation signature in melanoma" in PLOS Genetics by Brown et al. (2018) for additional details on the purpose of these scripts

UPDATE: A 1bp error was detected that affected a small subset of reads; by mis-identifying dipyrimidines. Analyses were re-run and the results were determined to be essentially the same. Affected scripts were fixed and are in the new folder "1bp Correction". Old scripts have been left for reference.
